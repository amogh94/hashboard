# About

"Hashboard" is a simple extension to store short texts. The idea is to be able to copy numerous texts (like URLs, names, or any other short texts) to your clipboard, without leaving the current tab. Option to add, edit, copy, and delete are provided.

**Credit** to [kunalnarangtheone](https://github.com/kunalnarangtheone/) for naming.

## Why was this written?

When applying online (endlessly) to jobs, I observed that most applications require you to paste multiple URLs (like LinkedIn, GitHub, etc). It was extremely frustrating to have to open a new tab, type the URL or find its bookmark, copy it, and switch back to the job application's tab again. 

And to do this for each URL it asks for - I wanted to improve this experience.

# How to use this extension

(**Update**: The looks have changed due to recently added features of: moving list items up and down, search bar, and download as CSV)

1. You will see this when it is opened for the first time. Hit the plus button to add a new text.

3. Your content is now saved and visible. Whenever you open the extension from now on, you will see the following. Use the icons to edit the title or text (URL), copy the text (URL) to clipboard, or delete this entry.
